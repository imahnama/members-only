## Project:Members-Only
In this project, we  built an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

## Steps Include:
- Setting up the Back End
- Generate a new rails app from the command line
- Add devise gem
- Generate User and Post model and fill out the migrations to get the columns you want.
- Run the migrations
- Authenticate signed in user.
- Only when Signed in can one see the author of the posts.
- All posts are visible when no User is signed in.
